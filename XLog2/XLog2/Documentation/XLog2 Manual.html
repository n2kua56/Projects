<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>This manual described the use of xlog, an open source logbook 
for amateur radio operators. It is available as html from the menu 
(Help $\rightarrow$ Manual or Ctrl + h) or as pdf in the xlog data directory.</p>

</sl>
<p>xlog is a logbook program for amateur radio operators, written 
with the help of the GTK+ libraries. The main xlog window consists 
of a button bar, QSO frame, and a browseable log. Logs will be saved 
to a flat text file. You can create, open and close logs as you need 
them. There is an optional scoring window available which keeps track 
of the most important awards. A ``worked before'' window shows QSO's 
with the same station you are logging. An optional keyer window interfaces 
to cwdaemon and is useful for contesting.</p>
<h2 id="first_use">First Use</h2>
<image src="newlog.png">
<p>When xlog is first started, an empty window is shown. You must select 
"Log $\rightarrow$ New" from the menu (Ctrl+N) to create a new log. QSO's 
are entered into the QSO frame on the left of the main window. Clicking 
the Date button will update the date field, the UTC button will update 
the UTC field.</p>
<image src="mainXlog2Window.jpg">
<p>After all the fields are entered, click on Add in the button bar, to add 
the QSO to the log list on the right side of the main window. QSO's can be 
deleted from the log by selecting a row in the log list and clicking on Delete. 
Likewise, a log entry can be changed by selecting a row in the log, changing 
the QSO in the QSO frame, and clicking on Update. Finally, selecting 
"Edit $\rightarrow$ Clear All" from the menu will Clear all the fields in the 
QSO frame.</p>
<h2 id="keys">Keys</h2>
<p>All of the above commands are available as shortcuts. For a list of keys 
used by xlog (in the English language) see the "Keys" window from the help 
menu (Ctrl+z). Most of the buttons in the QSO frame can be clicked using the 
Alt key together with the associated underlined character in the button. If 
any of the labels are underlined the entry next to it will get focus when the 
Alt key is used, when a default is present it will be filled in. You can access 
the menu with Ctrl-F10. You need to make sure that your window manager does not 
use Ctrl-F10, e.g. it is used by xfce to access the 10th desktop.</p>

<p>xlog stores and recalls several settings in xml format in the file $HOME / preferences.xml. 
To change these, select "Settings $\rightarrow$ Preferences" from the menu. You will 
see 4 different pages.</p>
<h2 id="info_page">Info page</h2>
<p>In order to calculate the correct distance to your location, you have to 
enter your longitude and latitude in the Info page. Here you can also choose 
whether the distance should be displayed in Kilometers or Nautical Miles.</p>
<image src="InfoPage.jpg"?>
<p>When you intend to make VHF/UHF QSO's and you have a QRA locator field in 
the log, you should also enter your QRA locator here.</p>
<h2 id="general_page">General Page</h2>
<p>This page allows you to choose an editbox to enter band and mode instead 
of using the default optionmenu. This is especially useful when using hamlib, 
so the extra digits of your frequency can be filled in. When "use free fields 
to add distance and azimuth to the log" is checked, distance and azimuth will 
be calculated from the locator field (when present) and added to the log.<p>
<image src="GeneralPage.jpg">
<p>When 'Enable type and find' is checked, all the logs will be searched for 
a callsign match and when found, fill in name, QTH, locator and remarks like 
in the previous QSO.</p>
<h2 id="logs_page">Logs Page</h2>
<p>In the Logs page you can decide where to save your logs and which logs to 
load at startup (in case there are no logs entered at the command line). Of 
course, you have to restart xlog and be sure to move your logs there. You can 
use wildcards or a list of logs separated by a comma. Extension .xlog will be 
automatically added, e.g. when using wildcards, 'p*' will load all logs starting 
with 'p' and ending with '.xlog'.</p>

<p>Xlog is compiled with hamlib support, so you can read your rig's frequency, 
mode, power and S-meter over the serial port.</p>
<h2 id="hamlib_preferences">Hamlib Preferences</h2>
<p>You must select the model of your rig and the port used from the list 
available in the hamlib page of the preferences dialog. If you want to use RPC 
rig, you should select localhost as a port. The same page allows you to display 
a dockable frequency meter and s-meter on the statusbar.</p>
<p><b>This may never be implemented</b></p>
<p>image</p>
<p>When hamlib is enabled, 3 clickable buttons are added to the QSO frame, so 
you can easily fill in frequency, mode and signal strength in the appropriate 
fields. If your log records power (required in some countries), there is also 
a clickable power button in the QSO frame. You can either chose to poll your rig 
continuously with a certain time interval or just retrieve rig data when using 
"Edit $\rightarrow$ Click All" or Ctrl-k. Your hamlib port can be configured in 
the hamlib page of the preferences dialog. You can enter things like: 
rts_state=ON,timeout=600,serial_speed=19200 here.</p>
<h2 id="testing_hamlib">Testing Hamlib</h2>
At his point you should probably read your rig's manual, to see how you should hook up your rig to the serial port. For my kenwood rig, I need a standard serial cable with two 9-pin connectors. You also need write permission to the serial port. On my system, this means I need to add myself to the dialout group, with a command like:
$ adduser 'username' dialout
Next, you can test hamlib with rigctl, a binary distributed with hamlib. See which rigs are supported:

$ rigctl -list
Then start rigctl with your model number, e.g. '210' for a kenwood TS-870S, hooked up to COM2:

$ rigctl -r /dev/ttyS1 -m 210
Now you can check out if mode, PTT, frequency, signal strength and power (all used by xlog) are retrieved. At the 'Rig command:' prompt, type:

f
: retrieve frequency
m
: retrieve mode
t
: retrieve PTT (TX/RX mode)
l
and 'STRENGTH': retrieve signal strength (-54=S0 and 0=S9)
l
and 'RFPOWER': retrieve rig power (0.39 = 100 Watts)
The hamlib FAQ at http://hamlib.sf.net/faq.html gives some answers to common problems. You could also ask around on the hamlib mailing list, see: http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/hamlib-developer.

<h1 id="printing">Printing</h1>
<p>You can either print a range or the whole log and you can choose which 
columns are in the output. Printing can be done in 2 styles: landscape with 
30 QSO's per page and portrait with 50 QSO's per page. The loglines will be 
evenly distributed across the paper. You need to make sure the log fits the 
paperwidth by either selecting the correct font or style.</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>The generated postscript file is sent to the default printer. If you are 
using gnome and cups, there is a little application called gnome-cups-manager 
for configuring printers. I case you are using lpd or lprng, you need to make 
sure there is an entry called 'lp' in /etc/printcap. In case printing fails, 
you can also print to a file. The file generated is log.ps in $HOME/.xlog.</p>
<p>For contest logs, you can enable 2 empty columns called 'Multiplier' and 
'Points' for calculating your score. If you choose the portrait style it is 
advisable to disable the 'QSL Out', 'QSL In' and 'Remarks' columns. Otherwise 
your log will not fit on the paper.</p>

<h1 id="qsl_labels">QSL Labels</h1>
<p>glabels is a gnome application for printing business cards and labels, see 
http://snaught.com/glabels. It is designed to work with various laser/ink-jet 
peel-off label and business card sheets that you'll find at most office supply 
stores. The following works with a glabels version higher than 0.4.</p>
<p>You can use the 'Save As' dialog for exporting the log to a type called 'TSV'. 
This will save your log fields in a TAB separated file. The fields you want to
export can be set in the "Save As" page of the ``Settings $\rightarrow$ Dialogs 
and Windows`` dialog. The exported file can be imported into glabels using the 
template called qsllabels.glabels in /usr/[local/]share/xlog.</p>
<sl>
<li>Start glabels</li>
<li>Open qsllabels.glabels</li>
<li>Select 'Merge properties' from the Tools menu</li>
<li>Point 'location' to the exported labels file</li>
<li>Don't change any of the Custom field keys, just click 'OK'</li>
<li>You are now ready to print</li>
</sl>
<p>You should customize the label sheet by using "Edit $\rightarrow$ Select All" 
from the menu, click on 'New', select the apropriate sheet from the pulldown menu, 
use "Edit $\rightarrow$ Paste" to copy the fields into the new sheet and move them 
around with your mouse until the fit on the label. Save this file to use as a 
template for your QSL labels.</p>

<h1>Log-Editor</h1>
<p>The log-editor, when selected from the tools menu, can be used to display or 
hide a number of columns in the log. 2 columns allow free entry, they can be 
given any name. Changes to the log columns will be committed once you save the 
log.</p>
<image src="LogEditor.jpg">
<pPlease note that it maybe desirable to select a common name for a free column 
when using ADIF export as described in the ADIF specifications at 
http://www.hosenose.com/adif/adif.html, section 3: Field Definitions.</p>
<p>The log-editor can also be used to set the columnwidth of the log. You 
should enter a number higher than 20. Changes to the column width will apply 
to all the logs that are currently open. Only the number column allows a zero 
width, you can use it to hide this column.</p>

<h1 id="dupe_checking">Dupe Checking</h1>
<p>A log can be checked for dupes from the tools menu. There are some 
restrictions on the frequency field when used in dupe checking. It should 
either contain a 'dot' after the MHz number or contain 3, 6 or 9 numbers 
after the Mhz number.</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>When using hamlib, the total amount of numbers in the frequency field 
can be selected in the hamlib page of the preferences dialog.</p>

<h1 id="log_sorting">Log Sorting</h1>
<p>If you select "Tools$\rightarrow$Sort by Date", your log will be sorted 
by date and time. Log sorting assumes that the whole log is created with 
the same locale. Also, the log date should have the format "dd mmm yyyy" 
in your locale, e.g. "01 May 2004" in English, "01 mai 2004" in French, etc. 
You can check the correct month name for your language settings by using the command:</p>
<xmp>$ date -date='01 May'</xmp>
<p>The time should be formatted as "HHMM", e.g. "1423". The sorted log will 
be marked as changed. It is recommended to save the log under some other name, 
so the original log will be safe. You should check this log for correct dates 
and times before overwriting the original log. If the log is not correctly sorted, 
start xlog from a terminal to see if sorting produces any errors.</p>

<h1 id="defaults">Defaults</h1>
<p>"Settings $\rightarrow$ Default" will show a dialog where you can fill in 
default values for logging. These values will be used when selecting "Edit 
$\rightarrow$ Click All" from the menu.</p>
<image src="defaults.jpg">
<h1 id="worked_before">Worked Before</h1>
<p>When you select Worked Before from the tools menu, a dialog will be displayed 
which shows a sorted list of contacts while you are typing in the callsign entry. 
This is especially useful in contests.</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>The number of columns shown in this dialog can be adjusted from the 
"Settings $\rightarrow$ Dialogs and Windows" menu (first page).</p>

<h1 id="scoring">Scoring</h1>
<p>Xlog will keep track of your DXCC scoring and will display worked and confirmed 
countries and DXCC information in a separate window, called the scoring window. The 
top table of this window displays the number of times a country is worked or "0" if 
confirmed. The bottom table shows the total number of DXCC countries.</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>Xlog can also keep track of WAC (Worked All Continents) scoring. You will have to 
enable it in the Scoring page of the "Settings $\rightarrow$ Dialogs and Windows" 
dialog. This will add an extra page to the scoring window.</p>
<p>Xlog will look up the prefix of a callsign and display DXCC information together 
with calculated distance and beam heading in the left frame. In a log where a QTH 
locator field is present, distance and azimuth to the locator is calculated and 
displayed in a separate frame.</p>
<p>If DXCC lookup fails you can enter a valid country in the AWARDS column of the 
log. The correct format for this string is 'DXCC-' followed by the desired prefix 
(see ''Help $\rightarrow$ DXCC list`` from the menu). Likewise, continent lookups 
can be corrected by adding a 'WAC-' string followed by the continent to the AWARDS 
columns. Valid continent names are AS, AF, OC, NA, SA and EU.</p>

<h1 id="keyer_window">Keyer Window</h1>
<p>The keyer window, available under the Tools Menu, is in fact a simple 
(contesting) interface for cwdaemon. You can program all of your function keys with 
CW messages and control your speed here. Clicking the stop button or using the 'ESC' 
key will abort any messages. You can also see a counter for serial numbers, a toggle 
box for short serial numbers and a menu for selecting either CQ or "Search & Pound" 
mode.</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>The bottom text entry can be used to typecharacters. The function key entries can 
use the following macros:</p>
<dl>
<dt>%</dt><dd>my callsign</dd>
<dt>@</dt><dd>his callsign</dd>
<dt>#</dt><dd>number counter</dd>
</dl>
<p>The number counter will auto-increment. The defaults dialog can be used to fill 
in default reports for a contest, the # macro can be used in the TX(RST) field of 
this dialog.</p>
<h2 id="cq_mode">Running a contest in CQ mode</h2>
<sl>
<li>cursor on the callsign field</li>
<li>enter on an empty callsign field will call F1: "CQ de N2KUA N2KUA test"</li>

</sl>

<h1 id="data_exchange>Data Exchange">Data Exchange</h1>
<p>xlog can exchange data with twpsk (version 2.0 and higher) by WA0EIR. When 
a callsign is entered, it will show up in twpsk's send widget (where you type 
your text) when hitting Shift+Alt+h. Shift+Alt+o will show 'hiscall de mycall'.</p>
<dl>
<dt>gmfsk</dt><dd>can send logging data to xlog, when clicking on the 'Log entry' button.</dd>
<dt>Marote</dt><dd>a rig control program for the elecraft K2 by AB6CV does the 
same when clicking on the 'Log QSO' button.</dd>
<dt>gpsk31</dt><dd>can exchange log information when the QSO details dialog is open.</dd>
<dt>ktrack</dt><dd>can exchange satellite information with xlog. In order to do 
so, you need to enable the 2 free fields with the log-editor. Next, select 'add 
data to QSO frame' in the last page of the preferences dialog.</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="import_export">Importing and Exporting Logs</h1>
<p>xlog supports ADIF, Cabrillo, EDI (VHF and higher contest format recommended 
by IARU region 1), editest, OH1AA, Trlog (tlf) and twlog import. Logs can be 
exported to ADIF, Cabrillo and EDI. The apropriate option menu should be 
selected for the file type when importing or exporting a log.</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>Please check your log before importing it and make sure it has the right 
log format. The "Log $\rightarrow$ Import" dialog adds a preview widget which 
reads the first 10 lines of your log, so you can check it.<p>
<h2 id="edi">EDI</h2>
<p>When using EDI export, you should have enabled the locator field in the log. 
Xlog will automatically calculate the distance and add it to the log. When 
using ADIF export you can decide to convert frequency to band. Please use the 
"Save As" page of the "Settings $\rightarrow$ Dialogs and Windows" dialog to 
set this.</p>
<h2 id="tsv">TSV</h2>
<p>The TSV (Tab Separated Value) export format is used by glabels (see the 
chapter on QSL labels), but this can also be used as a way to import log data 
into a spreadsheet. You can also use the "Save As" page of the 
"Settings $\rightarrow$ Dialogs and Windows" dialog to define the fields to export.</p>
<h2 id="cabrillo">Cabrillo</h2>
<p>The Cabrillo log format is the defacto standard format for log submission in 
many contests. It's aim is to be ``an interface between logging program authors 
and contest sponsors.'' As such, the information in the file is generally limited 
with respect to day-to-day logging of contacts.</p>
<p>Xlog will import from and export to Cabrillo 2.0 files using the QSO template 
for DARC Worked All Europe. This format is very similar to, and in most cases 
should work for the QSO template for other ARRL and CQ contests, Stew Perry contest, 
Oceania DX Contest and AP Sprint.</p>
<xmp>

</xmp>
<p>Xlog will additionally attempt to import QSOs from Cabrillo files claiming to 
be for the Sweepstakes, NAQP and NA Sprint contests by matching the CONTEST tag 
and adjusting it's input parsing accordingly.</p>
<p>Xlog does not have contest specific exchange fields, instead the exchange data 
should go in the RST field. On export the data after the RS or RST is split out 
for the exchange field of the Cabrillo file. On import the extra exchange data is 
joined with the RST into Xlog's TX and RX RST fields.</p>
