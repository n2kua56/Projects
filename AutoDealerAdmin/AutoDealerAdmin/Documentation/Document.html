      <p class="developer">This system, because the size is small, uses a
      paradign where only the Form1 code can have access to MySQL.  As forms
      are instantiated and shown, any data necessary must be passed in a form
      property.  On return from the form the DialogResult is checked and if
      the OK button (Usually titled Add/Update) then the data is pulled from
      the forms properties and the MySQL INSERT or UPDATE is called.</p>
      <p class="developer">This also rquires the forms to make sure the
      updated fields on the form have been saved in the properties.</p>

    <p>
      To dynamically build the web site pages information
      needs to be pulled from various tables.  Auto Dealer
      uses the MySQL system to build, access and maintain
      these tables.

          <b>PURPOSE:</b>The intent of the Vehicle Tab is to display ALL
          "ACTIVE" vehicles and to let the user select vehicles to EDIT or to
          ADD new vehicles.  EDITING and ADDING of vehicles is accomplished by
          launching the frmVehicle form.
      </p>
      <img src="VehicleTab.jpg" />
      <p>
          ALL information needed to populate the frmVehicle form is contained
          in the grid. Fields that are not necessary to be viewed have been set
          in display=false.  When the user selects to ADD or EDIT a vehicle the
          frmVehicle form is created and then the properties of that form are
          filled in, the Gallery photos are obtained and passed as a DataTable
          in the ??? property and then the form is shown.
      </p>

      <p>
          On return from the frmVehicle form IF the DialogResult is "OK" then
          the information about the vehicle is obtained from the properties and
          a vehicle record is either INSERTED or UPDATED. We take the cheap way
          out and refresh the grid by doing a new SELECT.
      </p>

      <p>
          Vehicles are made "INACTIVE" by setting the Ending Date to midnight
          of today's date.

      <p><b>PURPOSE:</b> This shows the currently defined properties that
      are used by the Web Site.  Adding properties here without the Web Site
      CODE making use of them has NO effect on the Web Site.  Changing the
      values here may have serious effects on the Web Site.  This tab is
      for the use of the Web Site programmer.</p>

      <p>
          <b>PURPOSE:</b> This form is to display the details about a vehice
          (if this is an EDIT or DELETE) and to let the user add or change
          values. In the case of an ADD the user will see empty fields and
          will fill-in whatever data they have.  The "Name" and category
          fields are required.
      </p>
      <img src="VehicleForm.jpg" />
      <p>
          The Vehicle section is were basic data about the vehicle is
          entered. Vehicle Name, Category, VIN and price.
      </p>

      <p>
          The "Short Description" is the text that will be displayed at
          ??? on the web site.
      </p>

      <p>The "Page Text" is displayed on the Vehile page.</p>

      <p>
          This is also where the "Small" picture and "Large" picture are
          Selected. The "Small" picture is displayed on the Web Site Category
          page and on the Vehicle Page. The "Large" picture is displayed when
          the user clicks the "Small" picture. See "Photo Tab" for details on
          getting pictures into the system.
      </p>

      <p>
          Pressing the "..." button to the right of the fileName will
          present you with the typical Windows File Selection form. Select the
          file you want for the "Small" or "Large". Once selected the picture
          will be displayed below.  <b>NOTE:</b> These displays are NOT the
          same size as will be shown on the Web Pages.
      </p>

      <p>
          Every attempt is made to make sure the Upload check boxes are set
          correctly (checked when the program thinks the picture file has NOT
          been uploaded yet. However here is where you can override and tell
          the system to upload the file or not.
      </p>

      <p>
          The Gallery section is where you can see the Gallery pictures that
          have been assigned to this Vehicle. The Gallery is a set of thumb
          nail pictures that are displayed on the Vehicle Web page and the user
          can click on them to see the larger picture.
      </p>

      <p>
          Right Clicking in the list of file names will let you select more
          Gallery pictures to be added or removed. The Photo page is where you
          can select the "Large" picture to associate with the thumb nail
          Gallery picture and set the Upload check box.

      <h3><a name="CategoryForm"></a>Category Form</h3>
      <p><b>PURPOSE:</b> To let the user define the Categories that will be
      used in the Web Site.  The user can change the sort order (sequence
      that the Categories will be displayed) and the text that will be displayed
      on the Web Site.</p>

      <p class="developer">When the Category Tab page needs to start up the
      Category Form, the form is instantiated, the properties are filled in 
      from the datagrid on the Tab form and then the form is shown.</p>
      <img src="CategoriesForm.jpg" />
      <p>The Category name is the name that will appear in the menu on the
      Web Site as well as at the top of the Category Pages.</p>

      <p>The Category Description will Display on the Category Pages on the
      Web Site.</p>

      <p>The Sequence is to set the sort order. There is no need for these number
      to be consecutive (holes like 1,2,5,6,20) are fine.  Even duplicate sequence
      number are accepted but you will not be able to count on the exact ordering
      for the items with duplicates.</p>

      <p>Not sure what the Web Page Description will be used for at this time.</p>

      <p>Pressing the "Add" or "Edit" buttons will cause the data to be saved
      and the form to be removed. The Tab page will be refreshed to show the
      changes/additions you have made.</p>

      <p class="developer">When control is returned to the Category Tab, the
      DialogResult is checked for OK (the Add/Update button pressed).  If so
      the code then pulls the data from the properties and makes the MySQL
      call to INSERT or UPDATE the data.</p>
