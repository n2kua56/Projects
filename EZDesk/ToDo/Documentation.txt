<!-- Image of the List of To Do Lists -->

<p>This project implements a TO DO list that will be part of the EZDesk
program.  It allows the user to Manage a list of To Do lists (Create
List, Rename List, Delete List).</p>
<p>Once a list is created the user can manage the Task (or To Do items)
that belong to that list. Tasks can be Added, Renamed, Deleted, Marked
as complete and set the target completion date for the task.</p>
<p>The user presses the "Done" button when they want to close the To Do
List dialog.</p>
<h3>To Do Lists</h3>
<p>To Do Lists are saved in the ToDoList table. The structure for
this table is:
<ul>
<li>ID</li>
<li>ListName</li>
<li>IsDeleted</li>
<li>UserID</li>
</ul>
This results of the querry to this table will be used to fill the 
dataGrid, the button "Add" is shown along with a textBox.</p>
<p>To add a List the user will type the description/name of the new list
in the textBox and then press the "Add" button. At this point the textBox
will be cleared and the new description is added to the dataGrid for
